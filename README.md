This is a simple, interactive Coffee Shop Management System developed using Python, designed to simulate a basic ordering experience in a coffee shop.

The system uses dictionaries to store the menu (coffee items and prices), and conditional statements (if-else) to manage customer orders and flow control.

About System Works :
The menu (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) is stored in a dictionary.
Customers can place an order by selecting items from the menu.
The system checks if the item exists and adds it to the bill.
If the customer wants to add another coffee, an if condition allows them to do so.
If not, the program proceeds to calculate the final bill.
If an item is not on the menu, the program handles it gracefully and continues

KEY ROLES :
Menu display with prices
Multi-item ordering support
Input validation for unavailable items
Total bill calculation
User-friendly prompts and flow

Python Core Concepts:
Dictionaries
Conditional Statements (if, else)
input() and print() functions
